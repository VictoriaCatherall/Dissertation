# Dissertation: Exploring SMS engagement via an interactive

My project is to work with the Africa’s Voices Foundation(AVF) to produce an interactive visualisation of the data collected in one of their projects. The project I am looking into is where AVF partnered with UNICEF’s Joint Programme on Local Governance (JPLG) to deploy the Common Social Accountability Platform to give the opportunity for citizens to start a dialogue with the local government in Banadir during the COVID-19 crisis. A three-part radio series was broadcast across 5 local FM radio stations in Banadir, where AVF asked questions relating to the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 and how the Banadir Regional Authority (BRA) are responding to the crisis. The dialogues created from the citizens SMS responses are what I have used to create an interactive visualisation to show the engagement of the citizens throughout this project.
